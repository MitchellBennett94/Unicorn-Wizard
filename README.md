##### ***Wizard Unicorn Healer***



This game is about a wizard who heals a wounded unicorn.

Thru perilous locations the wizard must search for missing healing ingredients, by match-making locations and ingredients, and, encountering foes.

Once the ingredients are found the wizard must call upon the correct spell, riddled in latin terminology.


**Installation/ Setup instructions:**

You will need the following to run this game:

\*Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 or higher.

&nbsp;\*A terminal or command prompt.



1\.  Download and extract Main.java file, then copy to IDE

(I used Visual Studio)



2\.  Copy java code onto IDE.

&nbsp;

3\.  Run compiler with Debug main option near public class section at top of code.

\*Run in terminal


Upon starting the game, you will be prompted for input. The game is controlled by typing commands into the terminal.


**Usage:**

As a text-based adventure game, the player will be asked to respond to prompted questions.

With each answer the player will need to match the location with the ingredient.

All while making sure not to guess too many times, or not guessing an ingredient if not existent of location.

Each location the player will have a chance of encountering an enemy player, who can cause attack damage such as goblins and boss battles.

The combat is based on a attack and defend mechanic that is accomplished with in-text prompt.

Finally the player will need to solve the latin riddle to cast the healing spell for the unicorn.

**Features:**

(Currently features variables, multiple arrays, branching paths, for and enhanced loops, Four-types of user-defined methods, and method overloading)



**Future Improvements:**

I would like to add more complex combat for the goblin at each location.

This would include different attack damages, with turn-based stratedgy style mechanics.

Also adding more riddles at each location to help with gameplay replayability.

I would also like to add dialogue options to give more realistic presence of characters enemy and player alike.
