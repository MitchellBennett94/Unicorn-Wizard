##### ***Wizard Unicorn Healer***



This game is about a wizard who heals a wounded unicorn.

Thru perilous locations the wizard must search for missing healing ingredients, by match-making locations and ingredients, and, encountering foes.

Once the ingredients are found the wizard must call upon the correct spell, riddled in latin terminology.

**Usage:**

As a text-based adventure game, the player will be asked to respond to prompted questions.

With each answer the player will need to match the location with the ingredient.

All while making sure not to guess too many times, or not guessing an ingredient if not existent of location.

Each location the player will have a chance of encountering an enemy player, who can cause attack damage.

The combat is based on a attack and defend mechanic that is accomplished with in-text prompt.

Finally the player will need to solve the latin riddle to cast the healing spell for the unicorn.

**Features:**

(Currently features variables, multiple arrays, branching paths, for and enhanced loops, Four-types of user-defined methods, and method overloading)



**Future Improvements:**

I would like to add more complex combat and a health bar for players at each location.

This would include different attack damages,  turn-based stratedgy style mechanics.

The locations could also have a if-else branching to give depth of exploration with story changing.

Or creating a multi dimensional riddle for making a spell cast.

I would also like to add more bridging story structure to make the game become more fluid throughout.
